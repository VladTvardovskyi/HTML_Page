     <br>Five Things You Should Know<br> About HTML5

     1. It’s not one big thing
  </h2>

  <p>
      You may well ask: “How can I start using <abbr>HTML5</abbr> if older browsers don’t support it?” But the question itself is misleading.
      <abbr>HTML5</abbr> is not one big thing; it is a collection of individual features. 
       So you can’t detect “<abbr>HTML5</abbr> support,” because that doesn’t make any sense.
       But you <em>can</em> detect support for individual features, like canvas, video, or geolocation.
  </p>
  <p>
      You may think of <abbr>HTML</abbr> as tags and angle brackets.
      That’s an important part of it, but it’s not the whole story. 
      The<abbr>HTML5</abbr> specification also defines how those angle brackets interact with JavaScript, through the Document Object Model (<abbr>DOM</abbr>).
      <abbr>HTML5 </abbr> doesn’t just define a &lt;video&gt; tag; there is also a corresponding <abbr>DOM</abbr> <abbr> API</abbr> for video objects in the <abbr>DOM</abbr>. 
      You can use this <abbr>API</abbr> to detect support for different video formats, play a video, pause, mute audio, track how much of the video has been downloaded,
      and everything else you need to build a rich user experience around the &lt;video&gt; tag itself.
  </p>
  <p>
     <a href="">Chapter 2</a> and <a href="">Appendix A</a> will teach you how to properly detect support for each new The<abbr>HTML5</abbr> feature.
  </p>
  <h2 id="two">
    2. You don’t need to throw anything away
  </h2>
  <img src="forms.png" align="left">
  <p>
      Love it or hate it, you can’t deny that<abbr> HTML4 </abbr> is the most successful markup format ever. <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> builds on that success. You don’t need to throw away your existing markup.
       You don’t need to relearn things you already know.
       If your web application worked yesterday in <abbr> HTML5 </abbr>, it will still work today in <abbr> HTML5 </abbr>. Period.
  </p>
  <p>
      Now, if you want to <em>improve</em> your web applications, you’ve come to the right place. Here’s a concrete example: <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> supports all the form controls from <abbr> HTML5 </abbr>, but it also includes new input controls.
      Some of these are long-overdue additions like sliders and date pickers; others are more subtle.
      For example, the <code>email</code> input type looks just like a text box, but mobile browsers will customize their onscreen keyboard to make it easier to type <code>email</code> addresses.
      Older browsers that don’t support the email input type will treat it as a regular text field, and the form still works with no markup changes or scripting hacks.
      This means you can start improving your web forms <em>today</em>, even if some of your visitors are stuck on <abbr> IE </abbr> 6.
  </p>
  <p>
      Read all the gory details about HTML5 forms in <a href="">Chapter 9</a>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="three">
      3. It’s easy to get started
  </h2>
  <img src="markup-with-arrow.png" align="right">
  <p>
      “Upgrading” to <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> can be as simple as changing your <em>doctype</em>. The doctype should already be on the first line of every <abbr>HTML</abbr> page.
       Previous versions of <abbr>HTML</abbr> defined a lot of doctypes, and choosing the right one could be tricky.
       In <abbr> HTML5 </abbr>, there is only one doctype:<br><code><pre>      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre></code>
  </p>
  <p>
      Upgrading to the <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> doctype won’t break your existing markup, because <a href="">obsolete elements</a> previously defined in <abbr> HTML4 </abbr> will still render in<abbr> HTML5 </abbr>.
      But it will allow you to use — and validate — new semantic elements like &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.
      You’ll learn all about these new elements in <a href="">Chapter 3</a>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="four">
      4. It already works
  </h2>
  <img src="rel-email.png" align="left">
  <p>
      Whether you want to draw on a canvas, play video, design better forms, or build web applications that work offline, you’ll find that <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> is already well-supported. 
      Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera, and mobile browsers already support canvas (<a href="">Chapter 4</a>), video (<a href="">Chapter 5</a>), geolocation (<a href="">Chapter 6</a>), local storage (<a href="">Chapter 7</a>), and more.
       Google already supports microdata annotations (<a href="">Chapter 10</a>).
       Even Microsoft — rarely known for blazing the trail of standards support — supports most <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> features in Internet Explorer 9.

  <p>
      Each chapter of this book includes the all-too-familiar browser compatibility charts. But more importantly, each chapter includes a frank discussion of your options 
      if you need to support older browsers. <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> features like geolocation (<a href="">Chapter 6</a>) and video (<a href="">Chapter 5</a>) were first provided by browser plugins like Gears or Flash.
       Other features, like canvas (<a href="">Chapter 4</a>), can be emulated entirely in JavaScript.
      This book will teach you how to target the native features of modern browsers, without leaving older browsers behind.

      5. It’s here to stay
  </h2>
  <p>
      Tim Berners-Lee invented the world wide web in the early 1990s. He later founded the <abbr>W3C</abbr> to act as a steward of web standards, which the organization has done
       for more than 15 years.
      Here is what the <abbr>W3C</abbr> had to say about the future of web standards, in July 2009:
  </p>
  <div class="p1">
      <p>
          Today the Director announces that when the<abbr> XHTML 2 </abbr> Working Group charter expires as scheduled at the end of 2009, the charter will not be renewed. 
          By doing so, and by increasing resources in the <abbr> HTML </abbr> Working Group, <abbr>W3C</abbr> hopes to accelerate the progress of <abbr> HTML5 </abbr> and clarify <abbr>W3C</abbr>’s position regarding the future of <abbr>HTML</abbr>
